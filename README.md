Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Theoretical Physics Student at the University of Milan, interested in Open Quantum Systems, Quantum Information/Computation and interdisciplinary applications of Statistical Mechanics. 
On the side I like to study some Snow Science as well, focusing in particular on Avalanche modelling and risk assestment.

My project:
- Quantum stuff:
  - Quantum walks with time dependent Hamiltonians and their application to the search problem on graphs.
