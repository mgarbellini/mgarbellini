Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Theoretical Physics Student at the University of Milan, interested in Open Quantum Systems, Quantum Information/Computation and interdisciplinary applications of Statistical Mechanics. 

On the side I like to study some Snow Science, focusing in particular on Avalanche Modelling and Risk Assessment from simulations.
