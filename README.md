Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Theoretical Physics Student at the University of Milan, interested in Open Quantum Systems, Quantum Information/Computation and interdisciplinary applications of Statistical Mechanics. 

I am currently working on Quantum Thermodynamics and Entropy Production for my master thesis with prof. B. Vacchini, prof. A. Smirne, and Dr. F. Albarelli.

On the side I like to study some Snow Science, focusing in particular on snowpack modelling and slab avalanches formation.
