Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in the Theoretical Quantum Optics group at TU Dresden (Germany), supervised by Prof. Walter Strunz.  
My main focus is on **strong coupling** open quantum system dynamics and **quantum thermodynamics**. 

On the weekend I'm always trying to find the next gnarly adventure in the mountains or on the bike.
